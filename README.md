# IntelliSpell-Intelligent-Spelling-Correction-
IntelliSpell is an AI-powered spell checker designed to help users detect and correct typos efficiently. It uses advanced algorithms such as Levenshtein Distance for error detection and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) for fast pattern matching, providing accurate word suggestions.

The core of IntelliSpell is built around a Trie data structure, allowing for quick and scalable storage of words from a dictionary. The system offers suggestions based on the closest matches to the input word, considering both spelling similarity and word length.
